# Salesforce_developer_superset
In this project I completed my certification on Salesforce developer superset Where I learnt lot of new things. 

During an intensive training and learning journey from May to July 2023, I worked on many challenging modules and projects to push my limits and expand my knowledge. These modules covered a wide range of topics, including:  Apex programming, integration techniques, data modeling, security best practices, etc. It was an exciting and fulfilling experience to immerse in hands-on activities, applied what i learned to real-world scenarios, and use Salesforce to solve complex business problems.This accomplishment marks the beginning of an exciting and fulfilling journey in my Salesforce career.
